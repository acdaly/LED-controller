I changed my idea from making a program that will take any music file and make LEDs react to it, to making a user interface in tkinter where the user can manually determine the brightness of each RGBW LED over a period of time. This week I wrote all the graphics code so the user can change the brightness of the various LED colors and see the expected color on the screen. They can also change the brightness of each individual color over a ten second period. I wrote the C++ arduino serial code to accept the color and respective brightness of the LEDs.
